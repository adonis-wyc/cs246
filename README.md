Since joining Silicon Valley Hands On Programming meetup, we gladly finished Edx/BerkeleyX CS100.1x and CS190.1x. Now we switched gear to Stanford CS246: Mining Massive Data Sets (Winter 2015).

I am still rudimentary in Java, so the major solution posted here will be coded in [Apache Spark Python](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html), [Python MrJob Hadoop](https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob) and [Ruby-Spark](http://ondra-m.github.io/ruby-spark/). [Wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget) in shell scripts will be used to fetch some practicing data.
